  <p>Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha. The Buddhist teachings are known as Dharma. Buddhism is about changing our perceptions of the world and understanding the buddha's teachings. The first thing to note about Buddhism is that the Buddha is not a God. He was a human man born in Ancient India. Buddhists may pay respects to the Buddha but do not worship him.</p>

  <h1> Four Noble Truths</h1>
  </section>
   <section class="section static">
   <p>Buddhists follow a concept known as the Four Noble Truths. The first Noble Truth is that life is suffering. This truth recognises illness, pain and ageing as part of life. This is an inevitable part of life and the Buddha guides us not in removing these from life but to help us deal with it. The second Noble Truth is that suffering is caused by craving and desire. The Buddha teaches us that a lot of our suffering stems from us having expectations of the world and getting disappointed when they don't go to plan. If we can stop having expectations of how the of how we think the world is suppossed to be and see the world for how it really is, we can alleviate a lot of our suffering. We are taught that that instead of just following our cravings in life, we can try to modify those cravings. The third noble truth is that suffering can be overcome and true happiness can be achieved. It is also important to note that this happiness is not pure ectasy, but rather a life of content, This state is known as Nirvana. The fourth noble truth is that the way to end this suffering is by following the Eightfold Path.</p>

  <h1>Eightfold Path</h1>
  </section>
  <section class="section static">
  <p> The Eightfold path consists of eight aspects of life which should be integrated into daily life. This path is a guideline which should be utilised when each step is understood and accepted as part of our mindsets and our lives.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="section parallax bg4">
  <h1> 1. Right Understanding</h1>
  </section>
  <section class="section static">
  <p>This involves seeing the world as it really is and not how you want or believe it to be.</p>
 </section>
 <section class="section parallax bg5">
  <h1> 2. Right Intent</h1>
  </section>
 <section class="section static">
  <p>This means deciding on our goals and what we want in life.</p>
 </section>
 <section class="section parallax bg6">
 <h1>3. Right Speech</h1>
 </section>
 <section class="section static">
 <p>This means recognising the truth and having an awareness for the efffects our speech can have on those around us. This states we should speak truthfully and thoughtfully.</p>
 </section>
 <section class="section parallax bg7">
 <h1>4. Right Action</h1>
 </section>
 <section class="section static">
 <p>When deciding how we should act, we should consider others and the world around us. This also includes the five Precepts given by the Buddha. These include: no killing, no stealing, no lying, avoiding sexual misconduct and not talking drugs/intoxicants.</p>
 </section>
 <section class="section parallax bg8">
 <h1>5. Right Livelihood</h1>
 </section>
 <section class="section static">
 <p>This promotes equality among all living things and a respect for all life. Your work or occupation must reflect this.</p>
 </section>
 <section class="section parallax bg9">
 <h1>6. Right Effort</h1>
 </section>
 <section class="section static">
 <p>This involves having a positive and balanced attitude. It should be balanced in the way that it is not too strained and tense, nor too lax and laid-back. Clear, positive thinking should be incorporated and negative feelings such as anger or resentment should be let go.</p>
 </section>
 <section class="section parallax bg10">
 <h1>7. Right Mindfulness</h1>
 </section>
 <section class="section static">
 <p>This means to be present in the moment and being aware of all around us as well as of ourselves and our actions. This allows us to be more aware of the factors that drive us as well as others around us and to notice the limitations of our environment.</p>
 </section>
 <section class="section parallax bg11">
 <h1>8. Right Concentration</h1>
 </section>
 <section class="section static">
 <p>This is the uncluttering of the mind and focusing on the goals which we wish to achieve. We focus our minds on one subject and we must select a subject worthy of our concentration. Being able to be present in the moment and concentrate on one thing is an important part of Buddhism and helps shape our own self awareness. </p>
