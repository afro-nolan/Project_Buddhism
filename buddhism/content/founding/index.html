  <h1>Life of Siddharta</h1>
  </section>
  <section class="static">
  <p><br>Siddharta was rumoured to have been born a royal prince and at his birth it was prediced that he would be a renouncer. To prevent this, his father tried to supply him with many luxuries. As he was growing up, Siddharta became more aware of human suffering. This made him realise that all the luxuries that he recieved could not change the envitablility of suffering. He sought many teachers and meditated in a forest until near starvation. Eventually, he realised this was only deepening the suffering, so he ate a meal and sat under a tree to meditate. Some time later, he attained <i>Nirvana</i>.<br>

These teachings are in the forms of the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. <br> After the Buddha's death, his followers spread the word of the Buddha's teachings and many different schools developed. An Mauryan Emperor named Ashoka the Great turned Buddhism into the state religion of India.</p>
