  <p>It began in Ancient India and has since spread throughout the world to become the fourth largest world religion. There are a wide variety of Buddhist schools with the main ones being Mahayana and Theravada but many of these schools are interrelated. The ultimate goal of Buddhism is to reach enlightenment or <i>nirvana</i>. Reaching nirvana essentially means reaching a complete sense of self-awareness and peace of mind. Nirvana can be seen as a state of liberation and unattachment, it can be reached through meditation. The Buddha was believed to have been the first person to reach nirvana. Buddhism is about acquiring a state of freedom from spiritual, emotional or mental restrictions.</p>
